Description: The package provides several functions for easy
    obtaining climatic niche of any species or group of specimens by a collection
    of their points of occurrence. Climatic niche space is constructed by PCA of
    predictors values of each point derived from BIOCLIM (or any given) variables. It also contains
    functions for making a reconstruction of the ancestral climatic niche by given
    ultrametric phylogenetic tree and for estimation of the probable distribution
    area of the ancestor by predictors values restored from PCA.
